<h1>Welcome to IST 4035</h1>
	<p id="one">Advanced Web Design and Application</p>
	<p id="one">Lecturer: Austin Sifuna</p>
	<p>This course is about web design and applications.<br>
	It involves use of HTML, CSS and javascript for the front-end design.<br>
	Web applications are usually built to handle business transactions.<br> 
	Given the sensitivity and volumes of business transactions, web applications need to be designed in such a way that the system can scale well,
	be secure, and flexible enough to easily accommodate future enhancements.<br>
	These considerations, among others, make building web applications a fairly complex undertaking.<br>
	This course explores various aspects of advanced web development, including Color Theory, Responsive Design, Advanced CSS Features, ECMAScript 6, Web Services, and JSON.
